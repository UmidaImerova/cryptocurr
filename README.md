Graduation project 

Seytech bootcamp, International cohort 21-11


Compulsory
1. Use REST API point in https://rapidapi.com/
2. Using React, build a webapp that queries this paginated endpoint. Use Redux to save the results and then print out the results as a list on the page.
3. Use Redux createAsyncThunk in your code
4. The app should be paginated with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is refreshed, the same results are shown). For example, localhost:3000/page/1
5. Write at least one component as a React class based component (the rest can be functional components).
6. Develop in GitHub and record development through commits (use proper commit names). The projects that do not have commit history will not be counted.
7. Host your code on Heroku.

1. Add a search field
2. Use Material-UI as a component library.
